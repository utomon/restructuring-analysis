## Files
- **restructuring_analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code and visualizations.
- **Dashboard (Tableau Public)**: A Tableau dashboard created to visualize the key findings from the analysis.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consists of the following components:
- **Total Performance Ratings by Age**: A line graph showing the cumulative performance ratings across different age groups.
- **Most Leaves Used by Age**: A bar chart visualizing the number of leaves used by different age groups, segmented by gender.
- **Performance Rating by Department**: A horizontal bar chart comparing the performance ratings across various departments within the company.

## Key Insights
1. **Age-Based Performance**: The analysis shows that younger employees (age group 20-25) have the highest cumulative performance ratings, which sharply decline as the age increases.
2. **Leave Usage**: The data indicates that employees in the age group of 20-25 also use the most leaves, with a noticeable difference between male and female employees.
3. **Departmental Performance**: The IT and Finance departments have the highest performance ratings, while other departments like Web and Management show relatively lower ratings.

## How to Use
1. **Jupyter Notebook**: Open the `restructuring_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the data analysis in Python.
2. **Tableau Dashboard**: The Tableau dashboard can be accessed on Tableau Public. Use the filters and interactive elements to explore the data and insights.
